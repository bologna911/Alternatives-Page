TLDR: My suggestions would be check out [stoat](https://stoat.chat/) or [fluxer](https://fluxer.app/) then maybe [nerimity](https://nerimity.com/) or [matrix](https://matrix.org/) if the first two really don't work for you and yours. 
(PSA, the [stoat](https://stoat.chat/) servers are having a hard time rn and so their confirmation email is gonna take a while to arrive, mine took like 12hrs a day or two ago.)
I have seen a lot of complaining about discord (rightfully so) and asking about what alternatives there are so I've made this list and will do my best to update with any good suggestions but this really does just come down to my personal taste. (apps in the same category not in any particular order.)
For clarity's sake I will be using unified language throughout these post regardless of what the specific platform calls something.
- Channel = Individual text/voice chats or rooms
- Guild = communities/groups/clubs i.e. discord "servers"
- Server = The software that is being run on a machine somewhere remote that is actually hosting the guild/channel

Assumptions that can be made about all of these. Limited bot selection, limited guild selection, and it's probably gonna be hard to convince your friends to move over lol.
### The Best
#### [Stoat](https://stoat.chat/) (used to be Revolt)
###### Pros
- Available on all platforms. (iOS and Android are in beta)
- Open source.
- Very intuitive for discord users.
- Easy to add bots.
- Easy to make and customize guilds.
- No features locked behind paywall.
###### Cons
- The sign up servers have been having trouble with this new large influx of users so it took almost a full 12hrs to receive my verification email to sign up (and the first time the link arrived dead so i had to do it again waiting another 12hrs).
- Not federated (ruining much of the advantage of being able to self host servers IMO).
- Android and iOS apps are in beta, the iOS app is especially beta.
#### [Fluxer](https://fluxer.app/)
###### Pros
- Good performance
- Dev is on a crunch rn to get it ready for more active community involvement on the code side and more friendly self hosting capabilities.
- Comprehensive free tier. With access to all features while selfhosting.
###### Cons
- Only has a, very competent, web ui for mobile but no apps at this time.
- In an open beta with a queue for signups if there is too large of an influx (I didnt run into this but ymmv).
### The Good
#### [Nerimity](https://nerimity.com/)
###### Pros
- Familiar user interface.
- Good performance.
- No NSFW allowed (if your not into that).
###### Cons
- No iOS app.
- No NSFW allowed at all (if you are into that).
#### [Root](https://www.rootapp.com/)
###### Pros
- Available on all platforms.
- Seems like full feature parity with discord.
###### Cons
- The layout is really going to take some getting used to.
- They got some big outside investment a last year to develop the app so it is 100% going to go to shit once they get a userbase and need to start showing the investors some returns.
#### [GameVox](https://www.gamevox.com/)
###### Pros
- Available on all platforms.
- Easy learning curve for people moving off of discord.
- Premium features are per guild not per user so only the server admin needs to pay for all to have access to premim features (larger file, more members, more channels)
###### Cons
- Free tier guilds are limited to 50 people, 8 text channels, and 3 voice channels.
- Private company that will make decisions that prioritize money over the userbase.
#### [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
> Matrix is really a server backend. There are many clients available for it but I would personally suggest [element](https://element.io/en).
###### Pros
- Available on all platforms.
- Open source (safe from this discord bs)
- Federated (extra more safe from this discord bs)
- easy and quick sign up
- multiple client options
###### Cons
- Some concerning metadata collection issues and historical ties that seem almost conspiracy theory level but I just don't have the capability to disprove any current concerns. [Here](https://hackea.org/notas/matrix.html)
- Definite learning curve coming from discord.
- Guilds are not the most intuitive. (please let me manually organize the channels in a guild matrix!).
- It seems like mod tools are not the best for larger public guilds from what I'm reading.

### Not ready yet
- [Spacebar](https://spacebar.chat/): I want this to be ready so badly but it just needs some more time in the development. Reverse engineered discord, open source and self hostable but too early in development (not really any vc at this time).
### Others
- [Chanty](https://www.chanty.com/): More aimed towards slack type people, also download is only available on Microsoft store for windows and my windows version doesn't have that so I cant really test it out.
- [Rocket.Chat](https://www.rocket.chat/): Must be self hosted or subscription guild hosting.
- [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/): Really really not aimed at gamers or clubs or communities. It's probably good if you want to get your workplace off of microsoft teams tho.
- [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/): Free to make an account but guilds must be self hosted or subscription.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/): I ain't even gonna try this one. It ain't it chief.
- MicrosoftTeams: This ain't it either fellas.
### Not really the same type of software but in my search on random internet articles I have seen recommended for some reason
- [Tox](https://tox.chat/index.html): Not really comparable feature wise. Aimed at secure private messaging between individuals mostly, no guilds just group chats.
- [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/): Just for voice chat not text or community guilds.
- [Ventrilo](https://www.ventrilo.com/index.php): Also really just a voice chat platform.
